                        Technology. In my short time there, I've already contributed to over a dozen <br />
                        projects and assisted with managing one project for one of the firm's <br />
                        long-time clients.
                        <br /> <br />
                        â€œPrior to this role, I completed a two-year internship with Mobile First, <br />
                        where I honed my mobile app development skills. Ideally, I would like to <br />
                        continue to specialize in mobile software engineering, an area where I know  <br />
